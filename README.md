# MNIST-Digit-Recognition-Deep-Learning

Digit recognition using ANN and CNN

This project implements machine learning models, specifically an artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It provides a concise and insightful exploration of both architectures for a fundamental image recognition task.

## Key Features:

* Built with TensorFlow, Karas.
* Achieves accuracy of 98% with ANN and 99% with CNN.
* Includes comprehensive data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
* Provides clear visualizations and interpretations of results.
* Offers flexibility for exploration and experimentation

## Technologies Used:

  * Python
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Seaborn
  * Matpplotlib
  * Scikit-learn
